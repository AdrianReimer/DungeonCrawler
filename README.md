# Dungeon Crawler

A 2D Dungeon Crawler with partially generated Dungeons and simple Ai.
Game built with [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com).



## What I've learned

* Game Programming in Java using the libGDX framework
* Partially Dungeon creation
* Simple oldschool Ai development using Statemachines
* Saving and Loading Json + Tmx Files
* Java Design Patterns
* Build-Management using Gradle


## Build the Project

* [Setup your development environment](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
* To build for desktop and create an executable jar file, use the commandline and navigate to your projects root folder, then type the following:
	* For **Windows**:
    `gradlew.bat desktop:dist`
    * For **macOS/Linux**:
    `gradlew desktop:dist`
    * You can find the resulting jar in the _desktop/build/libs_ folder.
